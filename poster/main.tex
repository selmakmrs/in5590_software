    % you can have 1 or 2 columns

        \section{Intro}
        Write a couple of sentences about your prototype here.
        \begin{itemize}
        \setlength\itemsep{0.1em}
            \item Enlist your goals from assignment 4.
        \end{itemize}
        
        Include the image from \textit{task 2} in the assignment. Additionally, include
        images from previous assignments that you see fit. You can choose whether you'd like to include 
        them in the \textit{extra column} or in the text.
        \section{Tools}
        Describe the tools used here. 

        Enlist most important components. E.g:
        \begin{itemize}
        \setlength\itemsep{0.1em}
            \item Dynamixel AX12
            \item Pneumatic cylinders
            \item Arduino
        \end{itemize}

        Include a description of the optimization of your robot control. What did you optimize and how did you do it?
        You can add the optimization plot if you think it is important to show, but it is not necessary here.

        Include a description on the software that is interesting. Like language, libraries used, algorithms etc.
        
    % this determines where your columns will be separated

        \section{Conclusion}

        Write a paragraph about how far you came in achieving the goals.

        Write a paragraph about the results of optimizing the control of your robot.

        Write a paragraph on \textit{Future work}. What would improve the robot? What could you do differently?
